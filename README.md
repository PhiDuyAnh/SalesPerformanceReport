## Recommendations & Next Steps

### Sales and Discount Strategies
- Review the discounting strategy used in Q2 2019. The correlation between high sales and low discount, particularly for the Games and Toys category, suggests that minimal discounting might drive higher profitability.
- Conduct a detailed analysis to evaluate the impact of discount strategies across all quarters from other years as well. Explore whether applying a similar minimal discount approach to other categories could replicate the success of Q2 2019.

### Product Performance Optimization
- Focus on improving profitability in high-volume but low-profit categories, such as Cell Phones. Consider revising pricing strategies, product bundling, or offering premium versions to boost profit margins.
- Identifying the factors behind low profit margins in Cell Phones and adjust marketing or pricing strategies.

### Product Class Insights
- Since Regular products dominate revenue, continue to focus on this class but explore opportunities to promote other classes (e.g., Premium or Eco-friendly) to diversify revenue streams by launching targeted campaigns and analyzing customer preferences.

### Manufacturer Partnerships
- Strengthen relationships with the top 5 manufacturers. Negotiate favorable terms such as exclusivity deals, better pricing, or marketing support.
- Aim to prioritize collaborations that consistently perform well.
